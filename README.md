<h2>About Me:</h2>

I recently graduated and obtained my Bachelor of Science Degree, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am currently interested in game development, virtual reality development, software development, web development, and artificial intelligence. I am currently working on a few projects, including a UDEMY course on Unreal Engine 5, another educational virtual reality application, and a 2D Pokemon-inspired game. I plan on taking another UDEMY course focused on full-stack development and .NET development once I finish my Unreal Engine course.

Some of my hobbies include video games, trading card games, working out, and collecting.
